# Yabt
> Yet another BASH theme 

Remember when we said with a few tweaks, you could use Yazt in bash? This is it.
Yabt is a simple yet challenging BASH theme manager in maintence that is still compatible with everything. You can still use prompts in plugins, mix 'n' match two themes, with a few modifications, you can even use it in zsh again, then even fish. (Yaft won't happen from me)

## Installation
Install is only supported via deb file. On RedHat/Fedora/SUSE, use alien, and on Arch/Gentoo/Void/Slack/macOS/Cygwin, clone manually using instructions from Yazt.
###### See docs/debian.md.

By default, no themes are added. You can add them yourself or copy from sources like [Oh My ZSH](ohmyz.sh) or [Bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it).
