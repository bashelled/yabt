# Yazt
> Yet another ZSH theme 

Yazt is a simple yet challenging ZSH theme manager in maintence that is compatible with nearly everything. You can use prompts in plugins, mix 'n' match two themes, with a few modifications, you can even use it in bash, then even fish.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/bashelled/yazt.git ~/.yazt
cp ~/.yazt/etc/templates/rcs/zshrc ~/.zshrc
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

On macOS and Linux, you can install using Homebrew:
```
brew tap bashelled/brew
brew update
brew install yazt
```

By default, no themes are added. You can add them yourself or copy from sources like [Oh My ZSH](ohmyz.sh) or [Bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it).
