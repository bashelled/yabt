# Yazt
> Yet another ZSH theme 

Yazt is a simple yet challenging ZSH theme manager in maintence that is compatible with nearly everything. You can use prompts in plugins, mix 'n' match two themes, with a few modifications, you can even use it in bash, then even fish.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/bashelled/yazt.git ~/.yazt
cp ~/.yazt/etc/templates/rcs/zshrc ~/.zshrc
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
###### Homebrew install has been removed and there are no plans on looking to reuse it.

By default, no themes are added. You can add them yourself or copy from sources like [Oh My ZSH](ohmyz.sh) or [Bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it).
